Dinosaurs were a large and varied group of prehistoric reptiles
that dominated the Earth millions of years ago, long before humans
were even about to appear. These animals populated all the habitats
on the planet: the oceans, the mainland and even crossed the air,
throughout 135 million years, from their appearance in the Upper
Triassic period until their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period
What were dinosaurs like? Dinosaurs were a very large and diverse group of
animals, of which Today we know more than a thousand different species,
from all corners of the planet. Some walked on two or four legs, were
herbivores, piscivores, omnivores or carnivores, and competed with other
species of prehistoric marine and even flying reptiles. Like modern reptiles,
dinosaurs laid eggs and probably created nests; but unlike them, the dinosaurs
they had an upright posture, with their legs perpendicular to the body instead
of to their sides.
Why did dinosaurs disappear? There are different possible explanations for
the sudden massive disappearance of the dinosaurs, which took place in the
late Mesozoic era, 66 million years ago. At that moment 75% of life on the
planet was suddenly lost, in what is known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary (or KT)
mass extinction event. The hypotheses handled by the scientists point to
some type of global climate catastrophe, the product of a sudden and intense
seismic and volcanic activity, or consequence of the impact of an asteroid
or meteor in the region that we know today as the Yucatan peninsula, in Mexico.
